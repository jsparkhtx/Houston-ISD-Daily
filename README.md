# Greater Houston ISD Daily — Auto-Generated Podcast (Free)

This repo builds a daily podcast that reads aloud news articles about Greater Houston ISDs, published within the last 24 hours.
It’s free using GitHub Actions + Edge TTS + Google News RSS. Output is an RSS feed + MP3 hosted on GitHub Pages.
